Logging in JavaScript




## Logging in JavaScript

Step one is to make sure that the right stuff actually is logged. Some thoughts:

Stack traces in any browser: http://www.eriwen.com/javascript/js-stack-trace/

## Logging alternatives

Some alternatives:
 
 * http://stacktracejs.com/
 * http://rescuejs.com/
 * https://github.com/flatiron/winston
  * https://github.com/ifit/winston-express
 * http://log4js.berlios.de/
 * Node version of above - https://github.com/nomiddlename/log4js-node
 * http://log4javascript.org/
 * http://log4js.sourceforge.net/
 * http://www.gscottolson.com/blackbirdjs/
 * Advanced platform - https://github.com/getsentry/sentry
  * https://getsentry.com/welcome/
 * https://github.com/bpaquet/node-logstash
 
 
winston together with winston-express could be an alternative for logging from the browser.

Sentry seams like a powerful and interesting alternative, perhaps too powerful?


There are winston transports for some centralized logging services:
