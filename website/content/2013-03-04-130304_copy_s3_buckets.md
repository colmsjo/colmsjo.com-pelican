Copy data between S3 buckets

AWS Pipiline seams to be a nice tool coming up. It is currently only available in US regions but I'm sure it will come in more regions.
One thing I don't see that it does handle thputh is copying data between buckets in different accounts. There is a Hadoop that handles
this, s3distcp.

I'll give this tool a go.


After checking the documentation I realized that  this tool only can work within one account. This is not what I need so I guess I'll have
to write a small script myself.
