# Technical Architecture

## Overview

### Server farm

The architecture is built around three layers:

 1. A load balancer
 1. Application server cluster - running apache and PHP where scaling is performed by automatically launching and terminating new instances
 1. Database server cluster - a Master/Slave cluster running MySQL

These servers make up a server farm.

### Environments

vTiger environments are created in the server farm. For each environment is a MySQL user and database created in the MySQL server. Each environment also has a separate vTiger installation on the application server cluster.

There is a set of vTiger environments used for development, test and production:

 1. Sandbox environment - used for "playing around". This environment is "reset" when needed
 1. Development environment - used for development and unit testing of new functionality
 1. Test environment - used for system and acceptance testing
 1. Production environment - each client has a separate environment

It is possible to create temporary environments (vTiger installation + MySQL database) by copying an existing environment.
