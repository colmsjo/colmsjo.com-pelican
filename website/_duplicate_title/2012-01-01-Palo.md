This script will install the Palo Suite on your system

During the installation you will be asked several questions about your system. If you don't know the answer to a question you can abort the installation at any time by pressing CTRL+C. Pressing CTRL+Z will stop the installation temporarily. You can restart the session by entering 'fg' on the command prompt. The installation program offers you some default values which are safe to accept on most systems, just press enter when you want to accept such an offer.
