Introduction to PHP framework excercise





I like to understand the detais in what's going on when developing new stuff. Here I'll collect my projects related PHP where the goal is to build keep everyhting small and simple to understand. 

[[Shrinking-CodeIgniter-Details]] - Shrinking_CodeIgniter - learn and collect a minimal collection of CodeIgniter that will get you started. You'll have logging, error management and unit testing setup once completed (all in only a handfull of files).
