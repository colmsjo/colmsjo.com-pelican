Xen and KVM can be used. Amazon seams to be using Xen. Having looked around a little on different articles, Xen seams to be a beter choice. 

Howto install xen: http://cosi.clarkson.edu/docs/installingxen/

Eucalyptus is a xen management tool. Is is running on top of Xen. Is also has support for Ec2. Not sure how it is installed??
OpenNebula is another alternative: http://blogs.plexibus.com/2010/05/19/eucalyptus-setting-up-a-private-infrastructure-cloud/
