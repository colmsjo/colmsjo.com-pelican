Stapes - Minimal JavaScript MVC Framework 





Working with Phonegap, see [More Phonegap](/121220_More-Phonegap),
I wanted a small simple JavaScript MVC Framework as an alternative to Backbonejs.

Stapes can be found here http://hay.github.com/stapes/

I've reverse engineered a design for the Todos example that is included in the with
stapes.

| Window         | onhashchange   |                |
| todoadd        | destroy        |                |
|                | dbclick        |                |
|                | keyup          |                |
