This guide describes how to install OpenQRM on the same server as xen and kvm is running. Installing on a separate server is simpler since the network bridges doesn't need to be installed.

Will install from source in order to get the latest plugins such as support for windowsetc.

#= 1. Preparations =

I installed CentOs 5.5 with the options:
* Server GUI
* Virtualization


#== 1.1 Install xen if it isn't installed already ==

You need to install Xen using yum if you didn't install the virtualization option. Take a look at this article if you need guidance: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/rhel-centos-xen-virtualization-installation-howto.html.

<pre>
# yum install xen virt-manager kernel-xen
# chkconfig xend on
# reboot
</pre>

#== 1.2 Create network bridges ==

Comment out the part of /etc/xen/xend-config.sxp that creates the default network bridges:

<pre>
cd /etc/xen
cp xend-config.sxp xend-config.sxp.org
vi xend-config.sxp

# (network-script network-bridge)
#
# Your default ethernet device is used as the outgoing interface, by default.
# To use a different one (e.g. eth1) use
#
# (network-script 'network-bridge netdev=eth1')
#
# The bridge is named xenbr0, by default.  To rename the bridge, use
#
# (network-script 'network-bridge bridge=<name>')
#
# It is possible to use the network-bridge script in more complicated
# scenarios, such as having two outgoing interfaces, with two bridges, and
# two fake interfaces per guest domain.  To do things like this, write
# yourself a wrapper script, and call network-bridge from it, as appropriate.
#
# Jonas C. - will setup my own bridges for OpenQRM ind Xen instead
# (network-script network-bridge)

# The script used to control virtual interfaces.  This can be overridden on a
# per-vif basis when creating a domain or a configuring a new vif.  The
# vif-bridge script is designed for use with the network-bridge script, or
# similar configurations.
#
# If you have overridden the bridge name using
# (network-script 'network-bridge bridge=<name>') then you may wish to do the
# same here.  The bridge name can also be set when creating a domain or
# configuring a new vif, but a value specified here would act as a default.
#
# If you are using only one bridge, the vif-bridge script will discover that,
# so there is no need to specify it explicitly.
#
# Jonas C. - will setup my own bridges for OpenQRM ind Xen instead
# (vif-script vif-bridge)

</pre>

Run ifconfig and check that xenbr doesn't exist anymore.

Create new network bridges:

<pre>
[root@hubert etc]# cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br0
#
# Jonas C. 100815
#
# Create a bridge for OpenQRM and xen
#
DEVICE=br0
TYPE=Bridge
IPADDR=192.168.1.11
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
NETWORK=192.168.1.0
ONBOOT=yes

[root@hubert etc]# cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br1
#
# Jonas C. 100815
#
# Create an internal bridge for OpenQRM and xen
#
# This bridge does not have a gateway to the external network
#

DEVICE=br1
TYPE=Bridge
IPADDR=192.168.10.1
# GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
NETWORK=192.168.10.0
ONBOOT=yes

[root@hubert etc]# cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br2
#
# Jonas C. 100815
#
# Create an external bridge for OpenQRM and xen
#
# This bridge has a gateway to the external network
#

DEVICE=br2
TYPE=Bridge
IPADDR=192.168.11.1
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
NETWORK=192.168.11.0
ONBOOT=yes


service network restart
</pre>



Check that the network bridges have been created:

<pre>
[root@hubert ~]# brctl show
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
br0             8000.000000000000       no
br1             8000.000000000000       no
br2             8000.000000000000       no
virbr0          8000.000000000000       yes
</pre>

#= 2. Installation =

<pre>
yum install subversion
yum install mysql-server
svn co https://openqrm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openqrm openqrm
cd openqrm/trunc/src
make
make (yes, two times)
cd etc
vi openqrm-server.conf
change OPENQRM_SERVER_INSTERFACE=xenbr0
cd ..
make install
make start

</pre>
