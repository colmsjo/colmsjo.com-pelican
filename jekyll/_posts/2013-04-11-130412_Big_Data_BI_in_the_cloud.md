Big Data BI in the cloud





## Introduction

Big data solutiuons is marching into the BI space big time. The space for traditional data warehouses
solutions will mos tlikely decrease and big data solutions with web based front-ends will take market
shares.

This is s high level overview over some alternatives.


## List of solutions

The open source Hadoop stack is dominating this space. These solutions are not very end user friendly 
but there are popping up miscellaneous solutions, often based on Haddop that adress that issue.

Some solutions:

 * SiSense - Web front-end. In-memory solution for the back-end, needs to be installed on a local server, cloud options are coming
 * KarmaSphere - appliance that neeeds to be installed
 * Datameer - 
 * Platfora - cloud and on-premise solution available
 * Birst

 My plan is to find some time the coming week to try these out.

## Datameer

I've tried to signup for a cloud based trial but haven't received any mail. I've contacted support about this.

 * Download - http://download.datameer.com/trial/Datameer-2.1/Datameer-2.1.2.5/Datameer-2.1.2.5.dmg
 * http://www.datameer.com/download-direct.html

The personal edition seams to run ok on my mac. The web based interface is intuitive and easy to use. JDBC drivers needs to be setup in order to access relational databses. 

An interesting feature is that there is an app market with apps for SalesForce, Zendesk, Web site stats etc.

start a medium size ubuntu 12.04 instance and login

Install Ubuntu desktop. I'm using a NoMachine client to login (VNC etc. can also be used) s

sudo nano /etc/default/cfengine3
sudo /etc/init.d/cfengine3 restart

sudo sh -c "cf-agent --verbose --define phonegap> cfengine-log.txt" && more cfengine-log.txt

# This needs to be fixed manually, the cfengine script doesn't
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
