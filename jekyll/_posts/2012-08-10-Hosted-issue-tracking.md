Hosted issue tracking solutions





Hosted Issue Tracking
#==================


Background

Have github for $25/month, 10 private repositories:

  * 20 private repositories costs $50/month


Requirements

I need a solution for managing tasks/issues that a team is working on. The team is typically small,
no more than 5-10 developers. 

It should be possible to enter a number of attributes on each issue:

  * Issue ID
  * Status - New / Functional Design / Technical Design / Development / Unit test / System test / Acceptance test / Closed
  * Assigned to - a team member
  * Estimate (possible split into estimate for design and estimate for development and test)
  * Time spent per team member
  * Description


It should also be possible to do some reporting:

  * Summary of time spent per issue over a specifc period
  * Summary of time spent per team member over a specific period  



Alternatives


### Redmine 

I'm currently using a Remine instance I'm hosting myself. 

Hosted Redmine is offered by:
  * plan.io - â‚¬9/month

It is not obvious howto move this into the a hsoted Remine though. I have not seen any tools for importing and exporting projects.


### Altassian JIRA

Probably the leader at the moment. $10/month for 10 developers with a free trail month.

I think I'll test this one...

 * Needs Tempo addon for time reporting, $10/month for 10 users

### Assembla.com

Similar to Github bus supports SVN, Mercurial etc:

 * Issues
 * Has module for time reports
 * Seams a bit difficult to navigate
 * Free git repositories up to 1GB
 * $49/month for 40 users, 20GB ($19/month for 20 users and 2 GB)


### Clarizen.com

Scheduling similar to MS Project:

 * Can import project files
