I've been experimenting with an approach for developing HTML apps that are
stored locally in the browser. The plan is to make it possible to develop
apps without leaving the browser. These htmlapps are managed with a package
manager called `hpm`.

It is all open source and can be accessed at [htmlapp.io](http://htmlapp.io)
