Introduction

Having a privacy policy is necessary these days. I've compiled this list of usefull
resources for developing a privacy policy.

* Review of generator from [ReviewSquirrel](https://reviewsquirrel.com/best-privacy-policy-generators/) - good first orientation
* Free three step guide from one of the gyus behind [iubenda](https://s2imon.github.io/pp4pp/)
* Example of a privacy policy that seams comprehensive - [Freshdesk](https://freshdesk.com/privacy)


More on Data protection within the EU

The European Commission has decided on rules for the EU countries to implement.
This is described in Directive 95/46/EC.

* [Directive 95/46/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1442330397711&uri=CELEX:31995L0046)
* [Article 29 Working Party](http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/item-detail.cfm?item_id=50083) - Independent organization setup by EU that publishes advice etc.

Bringing data out from the EU, for instance to servers hosted elsewhere, requires
some additional work. The Safe Harbour agreement between EU and US is not valid anymore,
but there are other solutions.

* [FAQ](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/international_transfers_faq/international_transfers_faq.pdf)
* EU-US [Safe Harbour](http://2016.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/) was declared "invalid" by EU in Oct. 2015
