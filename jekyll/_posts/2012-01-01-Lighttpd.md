Light and fast web server

#= Installation =

#== osx ==

<pre>
sudo port
install lighttpd


###########################################################
# A startup item has been generated that will aid in
# starting lighttpd with launchd. It is disabled
# by default. Execute the following command to start it,
# and to cause it to launch at startup:
#
# sudo port load lighttpd
###########################################################

Before starting lighttpd it must be configured. Basic server configuration is in the file /opt/local/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf.
Select which modules you want enabled in /opt/local/etc/lighttpd/modules.conf. Individual modules' settings are in
/opt/local/etc/lighttpd/conf.d.

Sample config files have the .conf.default extension. When updating lighttpd, you should investigate whether you need to update your
.conf files with changes from the corresponding .conf.default files.
