AWS don't have batch scheduling, let's do something in Node on Heroku





Requirements:

1. Make periodic calls to REST Services - typically php jobs hosted in AWS Elastic Beanstalk (or engineyard, phpfog etc.)
1. Possible to view log files in one way or another
1. GUI is not vital, can make changes in config/code that is pushed using git etc. 


# Online servies

There are probably some, found this in a quick search:

* http://www.onlinecronservices.com/
* http://www.webbasedcron.com/
* http://www.mywebcron.com/
* https://www.setcronjob.com/

Feels old school...

# NodeJS

Greater flexibility will be achieved with NodeJS.

Search for cron with npm:
```
$ npm search cron

Some notes:
 * node-cron seams to be fairly established (https://github.com/ncb000gt/node-cron)
